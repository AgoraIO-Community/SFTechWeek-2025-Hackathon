# HeyGen Video Avatar - Important Notice

## üé• Video Avatar Feature Status

The **HeyGen Video Avatar** feature is an **optional advanced feature** that requires special API access.

## Why You're Seeing This Error

If you see the error:
```
Failed to start avatar session: 404 Client Error: NOT FOUND
```

This means:

### 1. **HeyGen Streaming API Requirements**
- The Streaming Avatar API requires a **HeyGen Enterprise or Business account**
- Free and basic HeyGen accounts typically don't have access to streaming features
- The Streaming API may require special enablement from HeyGen

### 2. **API Access Limitations**
- HeyGen's free tier provides video generation but not real-time streaming
- Streaming avatars are a premium feature
- API access must be explicitly granted by HeyGen

### 3. **Current API Endpoint**
The app attempts to connect to:
```
https://api.heygen.com/v2/streaming/new
```

This endpoint requires:
- Valid Enterprise/Business API key
- Streaming API access enabled on your account
- Proper account permissions

## ‚úÖ **What You Can Do**
