# HeyGen Streaming Avatar - WebRTC Connection Issue

## Issue Summary
WebRTC connection fails after successful API authentication and SDP negotiation. ICE connection state goes from "checking" to "disconnected" to "failed".

---

## Environment

**Browser:** Chrome 141.0  
**OS:** macOS 10.15.7  
**Network:** Corporate network (possible firewall/restrictions)  
**HeyGen API:** v1 Streaming Avatar API  
**Account Tier:** Free tier  

---

## What's Working ✅

1. **API Authentication**
   - Endpoint: `POST https://api.heygen.com/v1/streaming.new`
   - Response: `200 OK` with session_id
   - API key validation successful

2. **Session Creation**
   - Session ID received
   - SDP offer received in response
   - ICE servers provided (5 STUN/TURN servers)

3. **WebRTC Negotiation**
   - Remote description set successfully
   - Local answer created successfully
   - Answer sent to `POST https://api.heygen.com/v1/streaming.start`
   - Response: `{code: 100, message: 'success'}`

4. **ICE Candidate Generation**
   - Total: 22 ICE candidates generated
   - Breakdown:
     - 18 host candidates
     - 2 srflx (server reflexive) candidates
     - 4 relay (TURN) candidates

5. **Media Tracks**
   - Video track received successfully
   - Audio track received successfully
   - Both tracks detected in `ontrack` event

## What's Failing ❌

**ICE Connection State Progression:**
```
new → checking → disconnected → failed
```

**Connection State Progression:**
```
new → connecting → failed
```

**Timeline:**
- 0ms: ICE state = checking
- ~5000ms: ICE state = disconnected
- ~5100ms: ICE state = failed

## Technical Configuration

**RTCPeerConnection Config:**
```javascript
{
  iceServers: [
    // STUN servers
    { urls: ["stun:stun.l.google.com:19302"] },
    { urls: ["stun:global.stun.twilio.com:3478"] },
    // TURN servers (3 Twilio TURN servers with credentials)
    { 
      urls: ["turn:global.turn.twilio.com:3478?transport=udp"],
      username: "...",
      credential: "...",
      credentialType: "password"
    },
    // ... additional TURN servers
  ],
  bundlePolicy: 'max-bundle',
  rtcpMuxPolicy: 'require',
  iceTransportPolicy: 'all'
}
```

**Browser WebRTC Capabilities:**
```javascript
{
  "supportUnifiedPlan": true,
  "supportMinBitrate": true,
  "supportSetRtpSenderParameters": true,
  "supportDualStream": true,
  "supportReplaceTrack": true,
  "supportWebGL": true,
  "supportRequestFrame": true,
  "supportShareAudio": true,
  "supportDataChannel": true,
  "supportPCSetConfiguration": true,
  "supportWebRTCEncodedTransform": true
}
```

## What I've Tried

1. ✅ Using Trickle ICE (sending answer immediately, not waiting for all candidates)
2. ✅ Waiting for all ICE candidates before sending answer
3. ✅ Using all ICE transport policies ('all', 'relay')
4. ✅ Verified ICE servers are properly configured
5. ✅ Confirmed media tracks are received
6. ✅ Following WebRTC best practices (Unified Plan, bundle policy, etc.)

## Questions for HeyGen Support

### 1. Network Requirements
- **What UDP/TCP ports does HeyGen streaming use?**
- **What IP ranges or domains should be whitelisted?**
- **Is there a list of required firewall rules?**

### 2. Diagnostics
- **Do you have a connectivity test endpoint?**
- **Are there known issues with corporate networks/VPNs?**
- **Can you see any connection attempts from my IP reaching your servers?**

### 3. Configuration
- **Is my WebRTC configuration correct?**
- **Should I use different ICE transport policy?**
- **Are there free tier network limitations?**

### 4. Troubleshooting
- **Could this be related to:**
  - Corporate firewall blocking WebRTC/UDP?
  - VPN interference?
  - Geographic restrictions?
  - NAT traversal issues?
  - Free tier rate limiting?

## Additional Context

### ICE Candidate Analysis
- **Host candidates (18):** Local IP addresses detected ✅
- **Srflx candidates (2):** Server reflexive addresses obtained ✅
- **Relay candidates (4):** TURN relay candidates obtained ✅

**Observation:** All three ICE candidate types are being generated, including relay candidates which should work even behind strict firewalls. This suggests that even the TURN relay connections are being blocked.

### Network Hypothesis
Given that:
1. All API calls succeed (200 responses)
2. SDP negotiation completes successfully  
3. ICE candidates are generated (including relay)
4. But connection still fails

**Most likely cause:** Network-level blocking of WebRTC traffic or specific ports, possibly at the corporate firewall level.

## Expected Behavior

ICE connection state should progress:
```
new → checking → connected → completed
```

## Actual Behavior

ICE connection state progresses:
```
new → checking → disconnected → failed
```

---

## Request

Please provide:
1. Network requirements documentation
2. Firewall rules/ports to whitelist
3. Diagnostic tools or test endpoints
4. Any known workarounds for corporate networks

Thank you for your assistance!
