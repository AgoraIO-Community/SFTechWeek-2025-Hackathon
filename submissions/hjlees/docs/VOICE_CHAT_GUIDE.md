# Voice Chat Guide

## Features

### üé§ Barge-In Support (NEW!)
You can **interrupt Luna while she's speaking** - just start talking and she'll immediately stop and listen to you. No need to wait for her to finish!

## How It Works

Luna's voice chat uses a hybrid approach combining the best technologies:

```
Your Voice (Microphone)
    ‚Üì
Web Speech API (Browser Recognition)
    ‚Üì
Transcribed Text
    ‚Üì
Groq AI Agent (Processing)
    ‚Üì
AI Response Text
    ‚Üì
ElevenLabs TTS or Browser TTS (Voice Synthesis)
    ‚Üì
Speaker Output
```

## Technologies Used

1. **Agora RTC** - Real-time communication channel (WebRTC)
2. **Web Speech API** - Browser-based speech recognition
3. **Groq AI** - Fast LLM for understanding and responses
4. **ElevenLabs** - High-quality text-to-speech (optional)
5. **Browser TTS** - Fallback speech synthesis

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Start Voice Chat
1. Open the application in **Chrome, Edge, or Safari**
2. Click "Voice Chat" in the sidebar
3. Enter a channel name (e.g., "my-room")
4. Click "Start Voice Chat"

### Step 2: Grant Permissions
- Browser will ask for microphone permission
- Click "Allow"

### Step 3: Listen for Greeting
- You should immediately hear: "Hello! I'm Luna, your personal productivity assistant. How can I help you today?"
- Status will change to "Listening..."

### Step 4: Start Speaking
- Wait for "Listening..." status (green badge)
- Speak naturally and clearly
- Example commands:
  - "Create a todo to buy groceries"
  - "Show me my todos"
  - "Create a reminder to call John tomorrow at 3pm"
  - "Mark the first todo as complete"

### Step 5: Wait for Response (or Interrupt!)
- Status changes: Listening ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Speaking ‚Üí Listening
- Luna will respond with voice
- **NEW:** You can interrupt Luna anytime by speaking!
  - Just start talking while she's speaking
  - She'll immediately stop and listen to you
  - No need to wait for her to finish

## Status Indicators

| Status | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Not Connected | Gray | Not started |
| Connecting... | Yellow | Setting up connection |
| Connected - Listening... | Green | Ready for your voice |
| Listening... | Green | Actively listening |
| Processing... | Yellow | AI is thinking |
| Speaking... | Blue | Luna is responding |

## Troubleshooting

### No Greeting Heard

**Possible causes:**
1. Speaker volume is muted or too low
2. ElevenLabs TTS not configured (will fallback to browser TTS)
3. Browser audio is blocked

**Solutions:**
- Check speaker volume
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Try refreshing the page
- Make sure ELEVENLABS_API_KEY is set in .env (optional but recommended)

### Speech Not Recognized

**Possible causes:**
1. Microphone not working
2. Speaking too softly
3. Background noise
4. Using Firefox (limited Web Speech API support)

**Solutions:**
- Test microphone in system settings
- Speak clearly and loudly
- Reduce background noise
- Use Chrome, Edge, or Safari
- Check browser console for "Speech recognition error"

### No Response from Luna

**Possible causes:**
1. Groq API not configured
2. Network connection issues
3. AI agent error

**Solutions:**
- Check GROQ_API_KEY in .env
- Check browser console for errors
- Check terminal for Python errors
- Verify internet connection

### Choppy or Interrupted Speech

**Possible causes:**
1. Slow internet connection
2. Browser performance issues
3. ElevenLabs API rate limits

**Solutions:**
- Check internet speed
- Close other browser tabs
- Will automatically fallback to browser TTS if ElevenLabs fails

## Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Speech Recognition | TTS | Recommended |
|---------|-------------------|-----|-------------|
| Chrome | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Edge | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Safari | ‚úÖ Good | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Firefox | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Opera | ‚úÖ Good | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |

## Advanced Configuration

### Using ElevenLabs TTS (Recommended)

For better voice quality, configure ElevenLabs:

1. Sign up at https://elevenlabs.io
2. Get your API key
3. Choose a voice ID from the voice library
4. Add to `.env`:
   ```env
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-api-key

   ```
5. Restart the application

**Benefits:**
- Natural, human-like voice

- Emotional tone
- Multiple language support

### Using Browser TTS (Fallback)

If ElevenLabs is not configured, the system automatically uses browser's built-in TTS:

**Pros:**
- No API key needed
- No cost
- Works offline

**Cons:**
- Robotic voice
- Limited customization
- Varies by browser

## Example Conversations

### Creating a Todo
```

Luna: "I've created a high-priority todo: Buy milk. It's due to‚Äî"
You: "Wait, make that medium priority"  [Luna stops immediately]
Luna: "I've updated the todo to medium priority."
```

### Listing Todos
```
You: "Show me my todos"
Luna: "You have 3 todos:
       ‚óã Buy milk - high priority (Due: 2025-10-08)
       ‚óã Call dentist - medium priority (Due: 2025-10-09)
       ‚úì Submit report - high priority"
```

### Creating a Reminder

Luna: "I've set a reminder for tomorrow at 3pm to call John."
```

### Completing a Todo

## Tips for Best Experience

1. **Speak naturally** - No need for special commands or keywords
2. **Interrupt anytime** - With barge-in, you can interrupt Luna while she's speaking!
3. **Use a quiet environment** - Reduce background noise for better recognition
4. **Good microphone** - Built-in laptop mics work, but external mics are better
5. **Clear pronunciation** - Especially for names and specific terms
6. **Natural conversation** - Feel free to interrupt, clarify, or change your mind mid-response
7. **Check browser console** - Open F12 to see what's being recognized and when barge-in activates

## Privacy & Security

### Local Processing
- Speech recognition happens in your browser
- No audio is sent to third-party servers (except Agora for real-time channel)

### Data Flow
1. Your voice ‚Üí Browser Speech Recognition ‚Üí Text
2. Text ‚Üí Your backend ‚Üí Groq AI ‚Üí Response
3. Response ‚Üí ElevenLabs/Browser TTS ‚Üí Audio
4. Audio ‚Üí Your speakers

### What's Stored
- Conversation history (in memory, cleared when you reset)
- Todos and reminders (in Appwrite database)
- No audio recordings are stored

## Debugging

### Enable Console Logging

Open browser console (F12) and look for:
- `üé§ Speech recognition started` - Recognition is active
- `üó£Ô∏è User said: ...` - What was recognized
- `üõë Barge-in detected! Stopping Luna...` - You interrupted Luna
- `üõë Interrupting Luna's speech...` - Luna stopped speaking
- `ü§ñ Luna says: ...` - AI response

### Check Network Tab

In browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab:
- `/api/chat` - Should show 200 OK
- `/api/tts` - Should show 200 OK (if using ElevenLabs)

### Common Console Messages

```
‚úÖ "Speech recognition started" - Good!
‚ö†Ô∏è "Speech recognition error: no-speech" - Normal, will continue
‚ùå "Speech recognition not supported" - Use Chrome/Edge/Safari
‚ö†Ô∏è "ElevenLabs TTS not available, falling back to browser TTS" - Working but using fallback
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Close unnecessary tabs** - Browser needs resources for speech processing
2. **Wired internet** - Better than WiFi for real-time features
3. **Good connection** - At least 1 Mbps upload/download
4. **Modern browser** - Keep your browser updated
5. **Adequate RAM** - At least 4GB available

## Next Steps

- Try different commands
- Adjust speaking pace to find what works best
- Configure ElevenLabs for better voice quality
- Experiment with complex queries
- Integrate with calendar (if configured)
