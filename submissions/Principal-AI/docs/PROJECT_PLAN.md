# Voice-Powered Principal Engineer AI - Project Plan

## Project Overview
A real-time voice interface that allows developers to have natural conversations with an AI Principal Engineer about their codebase. Users enter a GitHub URL, and the system loads the codebase documentation to power intelligent, context-aware engineering guidance.

## Agora Conversational AI Engine
- **Purpose:** Real-time voice communication between user and AI
- **Implementation:**
  - Capture user's voice questions about the codebase
  - Stream audio responses back to user
  - Low-latency voice transmission for natural conversation flow

## Groq LLM
- **Purpose:** Generate intelligent Principal Engineer responses
- **Implementation:**
  - Process codebase documentation context
  - Analyze user questions about architecture, patterns, decisions
  - Generate expert-level engineering guidance
  - Ultra-fast inference for real-time responses

## ElevenLabs TTS
- **Purpose:** Convert AI responses to natural speech
- **Implementation:**
  - Convert Groq's text responses to professional voice
  - Use voice that sounds like a senior engineer (clear, authoritative, friendly)
  - Expressive speech with natural intonation

## HeyGen Streaming Avatar API
- **Purpose:** Visual representation of the Principal Engineer
- **Implementation:**
  - Display photorealistic avatar that lip-syncs with ElevenLabs audio
  - Avatar reacts naturally to conversation
  - Creates immersive pair-programming experience

## Appwrite
- **Purpose:** Full-stack deployment platform
- **Implementation:**
  - Frontend hosting (React/Next.js web app)
  - Backend functions for GitHub integration
  - Database to store:
    - Codebase metadata
    - Conversation history
    - User sessions
  - Authentication for teams/users

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Day 1)
- [ ] Set up Appwrite project (hosting + database)
- [ ] Create basic web interface
- [ ] Integrate Agora SDK for voice I/O
- [ ] Set up HeyGen avatar display
- [ ] Connect ElevenLabs TTS

## Phase 2: GitHub Integration (Day 1-2)
- [ ] Build GitHub URL input form
- [ ] Fetch repository contents via GitHub API
- [ ] Parse codebase documentation (CLAUDE.md, README.md, etc.)
- [ ] Store parsed documentation in Appwrite database
- [ ] Create codebase context loader

## Phase 3: AI Integration (Day 2)
- [ ] Integrate Groq LLM API
- [ ] Build context injection system (codebase docs → Groq)
- [ ] Create Principal Engineer prompt template
- [ ] Connect voice pipeline: Agora → Groq → ElevenLabs → HeyGen
- [ ] Implement conversation state management

## Phase 4: Polish & Demo (Day 3)
- [ ] Test with example repositories
- [ ] Refine avatar and voice settings
- [ ] Add conversation features (reset, context switching)
- [ ] Create demo video
- [ ] Write documentation

## User Flow

1. User lands on web app (hosted on Appwrite)
2. User enters GitHub repository URL
3. System fetches and parses codebase documentation
4. Principal Engineer avatar appears
5. User clicks "Start Conversation"
6. User asks voice questions about the codebase:
   - "What's the architecture of this project?"
   - "Why did they choose this pattern?"
   - "How should I add a new feature to X?"
7. Avatar responds with voice + lip-sync
8. Natural back-and-forth conversation continues

## Documentation Standard Support

The system will look for and parse:
- `CLAUDE.md` files (your documentation standard)
- `README.md` files
- `/docs` directory contents
- Code comments and structure (optional for MVP)

## Example Repositories to Use
- [List your public GitHub repos here]
- Should have CLAUDE.md or similar documentation
- Preferably diverse project types (web app, API, library, etc.)

## Technical Architecture

## Demo Video Outline (1-2 minutes)

1. **Intro (15s):** Problem statement - understanding codebases is hard
2. **Demo (60s):**
   - Enter GitHub URL
   - Avatar appears
   - Ask 2-3 voice questions with natural responses
   - Show conversation flow
3. **Tech Stack (20s):** Highlight all 5 partner technologies
4. **Outro (10s):** Impact - making codebase knowledge accessible

## Technical Innovation ✓
- Novel application of voice AI to code education
- Real-time codebase context injection
- Multi-modal interaction (voice + visual avatar)

## Experience Design ✓
- Natural conversation flow (feels like talking to a real engineer)
- Visual avatar creates engaging experience
- Immediate feedback loop

## Integration & Use of Partner Tech ✓
- All 5 technologies integrated meaningfully
- Each serves a clear purpose in the experience
- Technologies work together seamlessly

## Deployment & Documentation ✓
- Live deployment on Appwrite
- Clear README with setup instructions
- Demo video showcasing features

## Risk: GitHub API rate limits
**Mitigation:** Cache repository data in Appwrite DB, use authenticated requests

## Risk: Avatar/voice latency
**Mitigation:** Optimize pipeline, pre-load avatar, use Groq's fast inference

## Risk: Context too large for LLM
**Mitigation:** Chunk documentation, use retrieval strategy, focus on key files

## Risk: Integration complexity
**Mitigation:** Start with simple pipeline, test each component independently

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All 5 partner technologies integrated and working
- [ ] Can successfully load and parse GitHub repository
- [ ] Voice conversation feels natural and responsive (<2s latency)
- [ ] Avatar lip-sync is believable
- [ ] Deployed and accessible on Appwrite
- [ ] Demo video completed

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Set up accounts for all 5 partner platforms
2. **Today:** Scaffold basic Appwrite + Agora integration
3. **Tomorrow:** Add GitHub parsing + Groq integration
4. **Final Day:** Polish, test, record demo
