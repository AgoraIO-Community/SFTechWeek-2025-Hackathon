# Evaluation Results Analysis - First Run

## Summary

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Total Questions:** 10
**Passed (≥70):** 7 ✅
**Failed (<70):** 3 ❌
**Average Score:** 71.5/100
**Intent Accuracy:** 70.0%

## Overall Assessment

**Grade: C+ (Passing but needs improvement)**

The system demonstrates solid performance on overview, implementation, and one comparison question. However, there are issues with:
1. Usage question intent classification (2/3 misclassified)
2. Voice-friendliness (several responses have too many code blocks)
3. Rate limiting on the last question (context too large)

## Category Breakdown

### Overview Questions: 80.0/100 ✅
**Status: GOOD**

| Question | Score | Issues |
|----------|-------|--------|
| overview-1 | 75/100 | Missing keyword "palace" |
| overview-2 | 85/100 | Response too long (351 words vs 300 max) |

**Recommendation:** 
- ✅ **Safe for demo** - Both questions passed
- Pick overview-2 for demo (higher score)
- Consider shortening overview-2 response

### Implementation Questions: 85.0/100 ✅
**Status: EXCELLENT**

| Question | Score | Issues |
|----------|-------|--------|
| implementation-1 | 85/100 | Should reference specific files |
| implementation-2 | 85/100 | Should reference specific files |
| implementation-3 | 85/100 | Should reference specific files |

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ **All safe for demo** - Consistent high scores
- File references not critical for voice demo
- Pick any of these for demo

### Usage Questions: 71.7/100 ⚠️
**Status: NEEDS ATTENTION**

| Question | Score | Issues |
|----------|-------|--------|
| usage-1 | 65/100 | Intent misclassified, not voice-friendly |
| usage-2 | 65/100 | Intent misclassified, not voice-friendly |
| usage-3 | 85/100 | Not voice-friendly but passed |

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ **usage-3 safe for demo** (85/100)
- ❌ **Avoid usage-1 and usage-2** (both 65/100)
- Intent classification needs tuning for "how do I" questions

### Comparison Questions: 42.5/100 ❌
**Status: CRITICAL ISSUE**

| Question | Score | Issues |
|----------|-------|--------|
| comparison-1 | 85/100 | Not voice-friendly |
| comparison-2 | 0/100 | Rate limit error - context too large |

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ **comparison-1 safe for demo** (85/100)
- ❌ **comparison-2 BROKEN** - Rate limit issue
- Need to fix context size for comparison-2

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Intent Classification Issues (30% error rate)

**Problem:** "How do I use..." questions classified as "implementation" instead of "usage"

**Affected Questions:**
- usage-1: "How do I use the MemoryPalace API?" → Classified as implementation
- usage-2: "How do I get started with this library?" → Classified as implementation

**Root Cause:** Intent detection patterns in `ViewAwareContextBuilder.ts` prioritize "how does" (implementation) over "how do I" (usage)

**Fix:**
```typescript
// In detectQuestionType(), add before implementation check:
if (
  question.includes('how do i') ||
  question.includes('how to use') ||
  question.includes('get started')
) {
  return {
    type: 'usage',
    confidence: 0.9,
    // ...
  };
}
```

### 2. Voice Friendliness Issues (60% not voice-friendly)

**Problem:** Responses contain too many code blocks or lack natural language structure

**Affected Questions:**
- implementation-2, implementation-3 (too many code blocks)
- usage-1, usage-2, usage-3 (code-heavy)
- comparison-1 (code-heavy)

**Root Cause:** LLM prompt doesn't emphasize "voice delivery" strongly enough

**Fix:** Update `buildIntentAwarePrompt()` to add:
```typescript
# IMPORTANT: Voice Delivery
This response will be read aloud via text-to-speech. Therefore:
- Explain code in natural language, don't just show code
- Use "first, second, third" instead of bullet points
- Limit code blocks to maximum 1 short example
- Use conversational tone suitable for listening
```

### 3. Rate Limiting / Context Size (1 failure)

**Problem:** comparison-2 hit 6419 tokens (limit: 6000)

**Root Cause:** Conversation history + full context from all previous 9 questions accumulated too much

**Fix:** Implement conversation history truncation:
```typescript
// In generateViewAwareResponse, before passing history:
const truncatedHistory = conversationHistory.slice(-4); // Last 2 turns only
```

### 4. File Reference Detection (3 issues)

**Problem:** Implementation responses don't cite specific file paths

**Why:** LLM doesn't naturally include file paths even when files are loaded

**Fix:** Update implementation prompt to require file citations:
```typescript
implementation: `
- Detailed explanation of how things work
- **MUST cite specific file paths from the code provided**
- Example format: "In src/MemoryPalace.ts, the init() method..."
- Reference specific lines when discussing implementation
`
```

## Recommended Demo Questions

Based on scores ≥80 and consistency:

### Tier 1: Safest (Score ≥85)
1. ✅ **overview-2** - "Explain the architecture of this project" (85/100)
2. ✅ **implementation-1** - "How does the MemoryPalace class work?" (85/100)
3. ✅ **implementation-2** - "Show me how the GitHubAdapter fetches files" (85/100)
4. ✅ **implementation-3** - "How does the prefetchAlexandriaFiles method work?" (85/100)
5. ✅ **usage-3** - "Give me an example of loading a repository" (85/100)
6. ✅ **comparison-1** - "What's the difference between getView and listViews?" (85/100)

### Tier 2: Good (Score 70-84)
7. ✅ **overview-1** - "What is this codebase about?" (75/100)

### Tier 3: Avoid (Score <70)
8. ❌ **usage-1** - "How do I use the MemoryPalace API?" (65/100)
9. ❌ **usage-2** - "How do I get started with this library?" (65/100)
10. ❌ **comparison-2** - "When should I use GitHubAdapter vs GitHubGlobAdapter?" (0/100)

## Demo Strategy

### Recommended 4-Question Demo Flow

1. **overview-2** (85/100) - "Explain the architecture of this project"
   - Why: Shows high-level understanding
   - Type: Overview
   - Safe: Yes, consistent score

2. **implementation-1** (85/100) - "How does the MemoryPalace class work?"
   - Why: Shows technical depth
   - Type: Implementation
   - Safe: Yes, good explanation

3. **usage-3** (85/100) - "Give me an example of loading a repository"
   - Why: Practical, relatable
   - Type: Usage
   - Safe: Yes, only passing usage question

4. **comparison-1** (85/100) - "What's the difference between getView and listViews?"
   - Why: Shows analytical capability
   - Type: Comparison
   - Safe: Yes, only working comparison question

**Backup Questions (if needed):**
- implementation-2 or implementation-3 (both 85/100)
- overview-1 (75/100) - if you need a safer fallback

## Action Items Before Demo

### Critical (Must Fix)
1. ❌ Fix comparison-2 rate limit issue
   - Implement conversation history truncation
   - Test that it works

### High Priority (Should Fix)
2. ⚠️ Improve intent classification for usage questions
   - Add "how do i" pattern detection
   - Re-run eval to verify

3. ⚠️ Enhance voice-friendliness
   - Update prompts to emphasize voice delivery
   - Re-run eval to verify

### Medium Priority (Nice to Have)
4. 📝 Add file reference requirements to prompts
   - Update implementation prompt
   - Re-run eval to verify

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (before demo):**
   - Run eval again to test consistency (scores should be ±5 points)
   - Practice with the 4 recommended questions

2. **Short-term (for production):**
   - Implement the 3 fixes above
   - Re-run eval, target 90%+ pass rate and 85%+ average score

3. **Long-term (future enhancement):**
   - Add more eval questions
   - Track scores over time
   - Implement A/B testing for prompt variations
