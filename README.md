# Agora Hackathon: Beyond Voice [October 2025]

Welcome to the Agora Hackathon! This hackathon challenges you to build voice-first
agents that do more than just speak. You’ll use Agora’s Conversational AI Engine as
the backbone of your agents, integrate ElevenLabs for realistic and expressive
speech, bring your agent to life with HeyGen’s lifelike video avatars, and deploy
your frontend with Appwrite’s all-in-one development platform.

The Agora Hackathon kicks off on Monday, October 6 at 6 PM Pacific Time and runs until Thursday, October 9 at 3 PM Pacific Time. No submissions will be accepted after 3 PM on Thursday.

Teams are allowed to be 1-4 members.

Teams must be registered here: https://form.typeform.com/to/wMYc4KxQ

This repository serves as the central hub for hackathon submissions and resources.

## **Theme: Beyond Voice—Agents That Do More**

In this theme, you’ll build a real-time, multimodal voice agent that does more than just respond — it listens, thinks, and performs. Your agent should integrate all core technologies to deliver a truly interactive, voice-to-voice AI experience:
- Agora Conversational AI Engine — Handle live, low-latency voice capture, transmission, and delivery.
- Groq LLM — Process text inputs with ultra-fast inference to generate intelligent, context-aware responses in real time.
- ElevenLabs TTS — Convert Groq’s responses into expressive, human-like speech with emotional depth and clarity.
- HeyGen Streaming Avatar API — Bring your agent to life with a photorealistic avatar that reacts naturally to speech and emotion.
- Appwrite — Deploy your frontend and backend on a unified platform with built-in real-time databases, authentication, and hosting for your web or mobile app.

Your project must integrate all five partner technologies. Submissions that omit any of these partners will not qualify for judging. Think creatively about how to orchestrate voice, avatars, and real-time actions to deliver an immersive user experience.
