# Agora Hackathon: Beyond Voice [June 2025]

Welcome to the Agora Hackathon! This hackathon challenges you to build voice-first
agents that do more than just speak. You’ll use Agora’s Conversational AI Engine as
the backbone of your agents, integrate ElevenLabs for realistic and expressive
speech, bring your agent to life with HeyGen’s lifelike video avatars, and deploy
your frontend with Appwrite’s all-in-one open-source development platform.
This repository serves as the central hub for hackathon submissions and resources.

## **Theme: Beyond Voice—Agents That Do More**

In this specific-theme hackathon, you must build a real-time, multimodal agent that
goes beyond simple call-and-response. Your agent should:

• Use Agora’s Conversational AI Engine to handle live, real-time voice
communication.
• Generate speech through ElevenLabs’ text-to-speech API, which offers emotional
depth and rich delivery for lifelike voices.
• Present an engaging visual presence through HeyGen’s Streaming Avatar API,
providing personalized and scalable interactions.
• Deploy your frontend using Appwrite, the open-source, all-in-one development
platform that offers built-in backend infrastructure, real-time features, and
hosting for your web or mobile interface.

Your project must integrate all three partner technologies. Submissions that omit
any of these partners will not qualify for judging. Think creatively about how to
orchestrate voice, avatars, and real-time actions to deliver an immersive user
experience.
